        high volumes of data in real time. An in-memory database (IMDB, also main memory database

        relies on main memory for computer data storage."

        description="Due to its IMDB property, SAP HANA enables data analysts to query large volumes of data in real time. 
        HANAâ€™s in-memory computing database infrastructure frees analysts from having to load or write back data. 
        Also HANA is a columnar-based data storage system and therefore it is ACID compliant(atomicity, 
        consistency, isolation and durability) and supports industry standards, 
        such as structured query language (SQL) and multidimensional expressions (MDX). 
        SAP HANA also includes a programming component that enables a developer 
        to create and run customised application programs on top of HANA."

        description1="SAP HANA stores data in memory in a columnar format. 
        Doing so enables the product to deliver real-time or near-real-time transactions and analytics. 
        For SAP, the columnar format offers better access to, and processing of data compared to traditional, 
        row-based memory."
        description2="SAP HANA operates on the SUSE Linux Server, which manages memory reservations for various processes. 
        Linux OS allocates memory dynamically as needed by SAP HANA, which uses a memory pool to manage in-memory data, system 
        tables, and computations. High data compression in HANA reduces overall storage requirements."
